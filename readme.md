Using this bookmark, you can create a Google calendar reminder for a Zendesk ticket.

Add the bookmark by editing a bookmark and pasting in the code.
(can also be deployed with a drag and drop if set up correctly)

How does it work?
Open a Zendesk ticket with an effective or due date, and click the bookmark.

The bookmarklet searches the page for the date immediately after the "effective on " text found on role change tickets.

If it does not find this text, it will look for a "due date" field.

Once a date is found, it will prompt you to create a new Google event for you with the ticket link in the description.
